### Cross-chain whitelist oracle

THis project was created for the Home DAO hack 2023.

# Overview

This project uses custom Chainlink data feeds that I created and served from my own Chainlink node.
This allows for access to whitelist for addresses on EVM chains like EThereum, Avalanche, Solana.

Bounties I am applying for:
- Chainlink
- Main track
- Defi track from TruFin (challenge #1 with whitelist)

Current MVP version includes:
- Simple example nodeJS backend serving centralized whitelist with option of adding new addresses for multiple chains, getting confirmation if 
given address is included in the whitelist or not.
- Chainlink node serving custom data feed from the API.
- Example Solidity smart contract accessing the whitelist check in a function.
